/*
 * Gate: the type contract — two weights, and no literal corner radius.
 *
 * The sibling of `check-no-literal-colors.mjs`, for the two properties that went
 * the same way color did.
 *
 * **Weights.** The library ships 400 and 700 and nothing else, which `fonts.css`
 * has said since the first face was vendored. Nothing obeyed it: `theme.css`
 * asked for 600 in twenty-three rules and `matter.css` for 800 in eighteen, and
 * every one of them resolved to a browser-synthesized face. It was invisible for
 * as long as `matter.css` was monospace — a system mono has every weight — and it
 * became visible the moment those rules took the brand typeface. A synthesized
 * bold next to a real one is the kind of wrong that reads as "cheap" without a
 * reader ever being able to say why.
 *
 * The two-weight rule outlived the font it was written for, and it was never
 * really that font's doing: GORP ships at least six weights, 200 through 700, and
 * only two of them were ever vendored as woff2. Source Serif 4 has eight and two
 * are vendored. Either way the ceiling is a decision about this design system
 * rather than a limit the typeface imposes. It is kept because the
 * hierarchy was built on it: a rule that wants "a bit bolder than body" has to
 * reach for size or color, which is the distinction that actually survives at
 * small sizes. Vendoring a third weight is a design change, not a bug fix.
 *
 * **Radii.** Same shape of problem. The radius scale is three tokens, and
 * `matter.css` carried literal `3px`, `7px`, and `12px` corners that predated
 * them, so a panel and a card built from the same system rounded differently.
 *
 * `999px` and `50%` stay legal. A pill and a circle are geometry — they mean "as
 * round as this box gets" rather than a step on a scale, and a token would make
 * them wrong at every size but one. `0` stays legal too: a full-bleed dialog
 * squaring its corners on a phone is a deliberate absence of radius.
 *
 * A boundary that lives only in a document erodes on the first deadline, so this
 * runs in `pnpm check` and fails the build.
