 * Accordion and Collapsible — shadcn's disclosure pair, on `<details>`.
 *
 * shadcn builds both on Radix, which reimplements the open/closed state, the
 * ARIA wiring, and the keyboard handling in JavaScript. `<details>`/`<summary>`
 * has all three in the platform: the browser owns the state, exposes it as a
 * real `aria-expanded` on a real button role, toggles on Enter and Space, and —
 * the part no JavaScript version gets — participates in in-page find, so
 * Ctrl+F opens the section containing the match.
 *
 * It also works with no hydration bundle, which the public pages need and a
 * Radix accordion cannot do.
 *
 * The trade against Radix is animation: `<details>` cannot transition its own
 * height without script. That is a fair price here — the design system has no
 * accordion animation to match.
