# @neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux

[Open the Navigator UX gallery](https://neon-law-source-code.github.io/navigator-ux/?showcase=home)

A React component library on the Neon Law teal, from Shook Law PLLC. No Tailwind, no Radix,
no CVA, no icon package — every component that can be is built on the platform primitive that already
carries its semantics, and every color resolves through a CSS custom property you can override in one
file.

Source-available under the [Business Source License 1.1](./LICENSE). Production
use defaults to Affero; read [License](#license) before you build a product on it.

## Install

Each release is a tarball attached to its
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux/releases). Install from the
download URL — no registry account, no token, and no `.npmrc`:

```bash
pnpm add https://github.com/neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux/releases/download/v0.7.0/navigator-ux-v0.7.0.tgz
```

React 19 is the only peer dependency. Five runtime dependencies come with the package and your
installer resolves them: `d3-array`, `d3-scale`, and `d3-shape` for the charts, `d3-force` for
`GraphView`, and `pdfjs-dist` for `PdfViewer`. They are externalized in the build rather than bundled,
so an app that already uses one of them resolves a single copy. Nothing else is drawn from outside.

The URL pins one exact version, so upgrading is an edit to the URL rather than a range that widens on
its own. See [docs/consuming-the-library.md](./docs/consuming-the-library.md) for the dependency form
this records and how to move between versions.

> script, so `pnpm add github:neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux` resolves, reports success, and leaves

## Public gallery

The component gallery and the thirty-page legal-work specimen are built as a static GitHub Pages
site on every push to `main`:

The sample site includes twelve Client Council voices, twelve Legal Council voices, and addressable
pages covering discovery, enforcement, company formation, immigration forms, and planning. It is
fictional sample data, not legal advice. The GitHub Pages workflow builds `gallery/` into the static
`gallery-dist/` artifact; the npm/library build remains separate and still emits only `dist/`.

## Use

Import the stylesheet once, at your app entry:

```tsx
import '@neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux/styles.css'

import { PublicShell, SiteHeader, SiteFooter, PageHeader, Card } from '@neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux'

export function App() {
  return (
    <PublicShell
      header={<SiteHeader brand="Your Org" links={[{ label: 'Team', href: '/team' }]} />}
      footer={<SiteFooter legal={<p>© 2026 Your Org</p>} />}
    >
      <PageHeader title="Matters" />
      <Card header="Recommended" highlighted>…</Card>
    </PublicShell>
  )
}
```

That stylesheet carries the fonts, the tokens, and every component rule. Nothing else is required and
nothing is fetched at runtime.

`ThemeProvider` is **optional** and sets no styling — see *Color scheme* below. An app served behind
the Navigator gateway also wraps in `SessionProvider`; a static bundle omits it.

## The three token layers

Three stylesheets carry the whole system, and the split is the point: swapping the middle layer
restyles everything and touches no component.

| Layer | What it is | Who owns it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The `--nav-*` contract at `:root`, and the Neon Law teal behind it. | The library — `src/styles/tokens.css`. |
| 2 | A brand override at `:root:root`. **None ships.** | You. |
| 3 | Every component rule, reading `var(--nav-*)` and never a literal color. | The library — `src/styles/theme.css`. |

The library ships one identity. If you want your own, layer 2 is a stylesheet you write and import
after ours — there is no build step, no config, and no fork:

```css
/* your-brand.css, imported after the library stylesheet */
:root:root {
  --nav-color-primary: #6d28d9;
  --nav-color-primary-hover: #5b21b6;
  --nav-color-primary-active: #4c1d95;
  --nav-color-on-primary: #ffffff;
  --nav-color-on-brand: #ffffff;
  --nav-color-link: #6d28d9;
  --nav-color-link-hover: #4c1d95;
  --nav-color-surface-subtle: #ede9fe;
  --nav-color-focus: #6d28d9;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root:root {
    /* A ramp that reads on white will not read on a near-black ground.
       Primary climbs to a lighter stop; its ink drops to a darker one. */
    --nav-color-primary: #c4b5fd;
    --nav-color-on-primary: #2e1065;
    /* …and the rest */
  }
}
```

Three rules make this work, and `gallery/brand-example-tokens.css` is a complete, commented template:

1. **`:root:root`, not `:root`.** Specificity is what makes a brand layer win, not source order. A
   layer that depends on arriving last silently loses the day something is injected after it. It is a
   doubled selector rather than `!important` so you keep the option of overriding again.
2. **Move the aliases, not the ground.** Surfaces, borders, text, radii, and the status colors stay
   single-sourced, so every brand inherits the same contrast work and geometry. Needing your own
   `--nav-color-border` is a design decision worth arguing for, not a default.
3. **Redeclare in dark too.** Skipping the dark block is how a brand ends up invisible in exactly one
   scheme.

`pnpm check:tokens` fails on any literal color outside layer 1 — including a *named* one, which is
why `FeedAccent` is `'brand' | 'link' | 'danger'` and not `'blue' | 'red'`.

## Color and contrast

Every pairing the palette defines carries a measured WCAG ratio, and `pnpm check:contrast` recomputes
all 88 of them from `tokens.css` on every CI run. A ratio nobody can verify by eye is a ratio that
drifts: the first run of that gate found two status colors that had never cleared AA in any release.

The neutrals are tinted, not grey. They carry a trace of the same teal, so a card, its border, and
the button on it look designed together rather than assembled. If you swap layer 2 for a brand of a
different hue, the ground stays teal-tinted — override `--nav-color-*` surfaces too if that reads
wrong to you, but measure it.

## Color scheme

The scheme follows the operating system. There is no toggle, no stored choice, and no `data-theme`
attribute — `tokens.css` does all of it inside `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

That buys three things: the media query resolves before first paint, so there is no flash and no need
for a pre-paint inline script; there is no stored state to disagree with the OS after the reader
changes it; and an app under a strict CSP needs no exception.

`ThemeProvider` therefore owns no styling. It exists so a component can *branch* on the scheme where
CSS cannot express the difference — picking a light or dark raster asset, say. `useTheme()` works
without it, reading the media query directly. Anything expressible in CSS should be a token.

## What's in it

The public surface:

| Area | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Surfaces | `Card`, `PricingCard`, `PricingGrid`, `TestimonialCard`, `TestimonialGrid`, `TestimonialSection` |
| Feedback | `Toast`, `Flash`, `Alert`, `LegalDisclaimer`, `ImpersonationBanner` |
| Data | `DataTable`, `Pagination`, `RowActions`, `ConfirmDelete` |
| Forms | `FormCard`, `TextField`, `SelectField`, `TextareaField`, `CheckboxField`, `RadioGroup`, `PeopleList` |
| Chrome | `PublicShell`, `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `NavigatorShell`, `NavigatorNavbar`, `NavigatorFooter`, `PageHeader` |
| Navigation | `Breadcrumb`, `ExternalLink`, `NavButton`, `NavLinkButton`, `NavBadge` |
| Prose | `Prose`, `Runs` |
| Icons | `Icon`, `ICON_NAMES` |

The shadcn-derived set:

| Area | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Disclosure | `Accordion`, `Collapsible` |
| Tabs | `LinkTabs`, `Tabs` |
| Display | `Separator`, `Avatar`, `Skeleton`, `Progress`, `AspectRatio` |
| Controls | `Switch`, `ToggleGroup`, `Combobox` |
| Overlays | `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Popover`, `DropdownMenu`, `Tooltip` |
| Notifications | `Toaster`, `useToasts` |

Each is shadcn/ui's component — its semantics, its ARIA, its keyboard contract — rebuilt on the
platform primitive that already carries them and styled in the same `--nav-*` vocabulary. That is not
minimalism for its own sake; each primitive brings something a JS reimplementation cannot:

| Component | Built on | Instead of |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Accordion` | `<details>`/`<summary>` | Radix reimplementing state, ARIA, and keys in JS — and losing in-page find, so Ctrl+F cannot open a collapsed section |
| `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `ConfirmDelete` | `<dialog>` | A hand-rolled modal that gets the focus trap, the top layer, the inertness, and Esc wrong in four separate ways |
| `Switch` | checkbox + `role="switch"` | A `<button>` that does not post, does not autofill, and needs JS |
| `Combobox` | `<input list>` + `<datalist>` | Popover + Command + a virtualized list, ~300 lines and three packages, that stops working when JS fails |
| `AspectRatio` | CSS `aspect-ratio` | The padding-top percentage trick in a Radix wrapper |
| `LinkTabs` | anchors + `?tab=` | Client state only — Radix Tabs cannot be bookmarked, refreshed, or opened in a new tab |

`Popover`, `DropdownMenu`, and `Tooltip` are the exception: no platform primitive covers them, so they
share one `useDismissible` hook rather than three hand-rolled copies. Esc closes, an outside click
closes, focus returns to the trigger, and the trigger reports its own state. Reach for Radix only when
you can name what the platform is missing.

The matter surfaces, on the same tokens:

| Area | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome | `CaseNav`, `Shell`, `CaseHead`, `Layout`, `Stack`, `ReviewNav` |
| Primitives | `Panel`, `Badge`, `Button`, `LinkButton`, `ButtonRow`, `Callout` |
| Review | `Decision`, `DecisionGrid`, `DraftCard`, `AuthorityList`, `AuthorityDialog`, `HarvardOutlineViewer` |
| Record | `SourceThread`, `CiteTheRecord`, `RecordCite`, `ClaimTable`, `FactGrid`, `DownloadGrid`, `ActionList`, `Record`, `StatusStrip` |
| Platform | `ThemeProvider`/`useTheme`, `SessionProvider`/`useSession` |

## The three contracts

Every component obeys all three. Each is enforced, not just documented — a boundary that lives only
in a document erodes on the first deadline.

1. **The leaf rule.** A themed component imports no application module: no router, no session, no
   application state, no data access. It takes data and callbacks as props.
2. **Injected links.** A navigable component takes an `href` and renders a plain anchor. Nothing
   imports a router. A client that wants client-side navigation supplies it at the call site — which
   is what lets these render a server-only page that ships no hydration bundle.
3. **Brand tokens.** Components emit semantic class names, and every color resolves through a
   `--nav-*` custom property. Enforced by `pnpm check:tokens`.

## Typography

One family, self-hosted, two weights at 400 and 700. There is no medium and no semibold, so
weight-based hierarchy is binary and everything else is size and color. `pnpm check:type` fails on any
other weight — the rule was documented for a year while forty-one rules quietly asked for a
synthesized 600 or 800, which is why it is now a gate.

**We recommend GORP Serif, and we do not ship it.** GORP is the face this library was designed on and
the one Neon Law uses; it is a commercial typeface from [TrashType](https://trashtype.com/), and
buying a licence is the way to get it. It is not the Firm's to redistribute, and a public
npm package would hand its binaries to everyone who runs `pnpm add` — so it is not in this repository,
not in `dist`, and not in the git history.

What ships instead is **Source Serif 4**, under the SIL Open Font License, vendored as two
latin-subset woff2 files totalling 44 KB. It is a genuine typeface rather than a placeholder, and if
you never think about this section again the library looks finished.

If you do license GORP, wiring it up is one stylesheet and no fork. `--nav-font-family` already names
it first, so declaring the `@font-face` is the whole of it:

```css
/* your-fonts.css, imported after the library stylesheet */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'GORP Serif';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('/fonts/GORPSerif-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'GORP Serif';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('/fonts/GORPSerif-Bold.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

Serve the files from your own origin, as your licence almost certainly requires and as the bundle gate
below assumes. Any other face works the same way — override `--nav-font-family` in your brand layer.

One thing to know before you do. The matter surfaces set `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so that
columns of currency line up, and that property is inert in a face with no `tnum` feature — it fails
silently, leaving the column ragged with nothing to report it. Source Serif 4 carries `tnum` and
`pnum` in both shipped weights. **GORP does not carry `tnum` at all**, in any weight, so a docket or a
table of figures will not align under it. That is a property of the typeface rather than of this
library, and it is the one thing you give up by using the recommended face.

The woff2 files are vendored and emitted beside the stylesheet; nothing is fetched from a CDN, and a
CDN would not be an option — a remote font in a library that loads on every page of an authenticated
portal is a third party watching every one of them. `pnpm check:bundle` fails the build on any
off-origin reference in `dist`.

## Authentication

Components never verify a JWT. They read an already-verified session and render. The Pingora gateway
in front of each app validates the Navigator `navigator_session` token and exposes the verified claims
at `/__session`; `SessionProvider` reads that endpoint, counts the 8-hour expiry down, and warns
before it lapses. See [docs/gateway.md](./docs/gateway.md).

A component that validated its own token would be trusting a value the reader controls.

## Develop

The repository *is* the package — `src/` at the root, no workspace, no `packages/` directory. Clone it
and every command runs from where you are.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm gallery            # every component on one page at :5174, from src
pnpm check              # what CI runs
```

`pnpm check` is lint, four source gates, the build, typecheck, the bundle gate, and tests with
coverage:

| Gate | Fails on |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm lint` | oxlint errors. Warnings do not fail; the expected count is three. |
| `pnpm check:tokens` | Any literal color outside the token layer — including a named one. |
| `pnpm check:type` | A font weight that is not 400 or 700, or a radius that is neither a token nor geometry. |
| `pnpm check:contrast` | Any palette pairing under its WCAG floor, recomputed from `tokens.css`. |
| `pnpm check:bundle` | Any off-origin reference in `dist`. Runs after the build, where a remote URL would appear. |
| `pnpm test:coverage` | Coverage under 90% on statements, lines, functions, or branches. |

### The gallery

`pnpm gallery` serves <http://localhost:5174>. Every block on it is the real component, imported from
`src` rather than `dist`, so a component edit shows up without a build and the page cannot drift from
the library the way a hand-written specimen page does.

It also carries the one control an app does not: a **brand-layer switch**. That is not a theme toggle
— the color scheme still follows the OS and has no control anywhere. It attaches and detaches
`gallery/brand-example-tokens.css`, which is the only way to see the claim the three-layer split
makes: the same components, re-toned, with no component touched. The brand swatches repaint; the
shared tokens beside them do not move.

The gallery is a dev server, not a build target, and has its own `vite.gallery.config.ts` because
`vite.config.ts` is a library build — one config trying to be both would emit the gallery into `dist`
and ship it to every consumer. It is typechecked, linted, and covered by the token gate: the gallery
should not be the one place that models bad habits.

## Releasing

CI releases on a `v*` tag and on nothing else, so a merge to `main` ships nothing on its own. Bump the
version in `package.json`, merge, then tag:

```bash
git tag -s v0.7.0 -m "navigator-ux 0.7.0"
git push origin v0.7.0
```

The tag and `package.json` have to agree. CI asserts it before anything else runs and fails the
release if they differ, because nothing else would catch the mismatch: the tarball is named from the
manifest regardless of the tag it was built from, so tagging `v0.2.0` without bumping would attach a
`0.1.0` tarball to a release called `v0.2.0`.

The release job then builds, runs `pnpm pack`, and attaches the tarball to the GitHub Release for the
tag. That tarball is the distribution channel; the filename is pinned rather than derived, because
consumers paste the URL into a manifest by hand.

**Nothing is published to npmjs.com.** The GitHub Release tarball is the only channel — there is no
registry publish step in CI, no package under the `@neon-law-source-code` scope, and no token that
would create one. If you are looking for `pnpm add @neon-law-source-code/navigator-ux`, it does not
exist; use the release URL above.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Two things worth knowing before you open one:

- **Run `pnpm check`.** It is exactly what CI runs, and the gates are cheap to trip — a named color
  in a component or a `font-weight: 600` will fail the build.
- **Contributions assign to Shook Law PLLC** and reach the tree under BUSL-1.1, matching the rest of
  the work. See [NOTICE](./NOTICE).

The conventions that are not obvious from the code — and the reasons behind them — are in
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). It is written for coding agents and is just as useful to people.

Navigator UX is source-available under the **Business Source License 1.1**. You may read, copy,
modify, create derivative works from, and redistribute it, and you may make any non-production use of
it. Production use **defaults to AGPL-3.0-only**: the Additional Use Grant lets you ship these
components if you comply with Affero, including the network-use obligations. Production use that does
not take Affero requires a commercial license from Shook Law PLLC. Four years after a given version
is published, that version converts to **AGPL-3.0-only** for everyone, and the BUSL restriction ends
for it permanently.

[`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) is the instrument: BUSL-1.1 with its parameters filled in (`Licensor: Shook Law
PLLC`, `Licensed Work: Navigator UX`, Additional Use Grant of production use under AGPL-3.0-only,
`Change License: AGPL-3.0-only`) and nothing else in the file, so licence scanners name the
instrument. The copyright holder's account of how that grant applies — including what production use
means for a component library — is in [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE).

**What that means for an application that imports this library.** Importing a component puts the
library in your bundle. Evaluating it and developing against it is non-production use. Shipping it in
an application that delivers legal services to other people is production use: take Affero, or obtain
a commercial license. How you installed the package changes nothing about this: a dependency boundary
is not a license boundary. Already-published copies under AGPL-3.0-only remain available under that
license to anyone who has them; relicensing is forward-only.

If you need production use without Affero, write to contact@neonlaw.org. The copyright holder is the
only party who can grant a commercial license. Affero remains available without asking.

### Third-party material

The grant above covers the work Shook Law PLLC owns. It does not reach the third-party material
shipped alongside it, which carries its own copyright and its own terms — the bundled typeface under
the SIL Open Font License 1.1, and two MIT-licensed sources. Those are listed, with the notices their
licenses require, in [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](./THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), which is published with this
file and with the package. Where those terms and BUSL differ, the third-party terms govern that
material.

**The runtime dependencies are a separate matter, and lighter.** `d3-array`, `d3-scale`, `d3-shape`
and `d3-force` are ISC; `pdfjs-dist` is Apache-2.0. None of them is bundled — the build externalizes
every one, so what you install from this package contains import statements rather than copies, and
your own installer places each dependency with its own license file. They are listed in the notices
file for completeness rather than obligation. Both licenses sit comfortably inside BUSL and inside
the eventual AGPL-3.0-only conversion; Apache-2.0 does so with AGPLv3 in one direction only, which the
notices file explains.

The font is worth stating separately: the OFL requires the font software to stay under the OFL and
forbids relicensing it, so **the two woff2 files are not BUSL** and BUSL does not purport to cover
them. Nothing here licenses anything the Firm does not own.

### Trademarks

The license covers the code. It does not grant rights in the Neon Law name, logos, or other
trademarks. Fork the library freely; do not imply the Firm endorses your fork.
